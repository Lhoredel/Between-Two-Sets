# Between-Two-Sets
This code solves the Between Two Sets problem by finding numbers that are multiples of all elements in the first array and factors of all elements in the second array.
The code calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the first array and the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the second array, then counts how many multiples of the LCM evenly divide the GCD.
